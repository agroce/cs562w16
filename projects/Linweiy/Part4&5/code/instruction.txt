1. All the tested files are from Python Library “Algorithms”, Corresponding code
files have been pasted into current files, so TSTL can be tested directly without 
install Python Library mentioned above(you can install it either).

2. two data structures Stack and Queue have been preliminary tested. Including:
	(a)Function usability in Stack (add,remove,is_empty,stack_list)
	(b)Function usability in Queue (add,remove,is_empty,stack_list)
	
3. randomtester.py is attached. To test,type those into terminal: 
	step1: type “tstl filename —nocover”
	step2: running “python randomtester.py”
