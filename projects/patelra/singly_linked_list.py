"""
    Singly Linked List
    ------------------
    A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which
    together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is
    composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next
    node in the sequence; more complex variants add additional links. This
    structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any
    position in the sequence.
