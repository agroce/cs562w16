        FuzzyWuzzy
        ==========
        
        Fuzzy string matching like a boss. It uses `Levenshtein Distance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>`_ to help calculate differences between sequences in a simple to use package.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        -  Python 2.4 or higher
        -  difflib
        -  python-Levenshtein (optional, provides a 4-10x speedup in String
           Matching)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using PIP via PyPI
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install fuzzywuzzy
        
        Using PIP via Github
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install git+git://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy.git@0.8.1#egg=fuzzywuzzy
        
        Adding to your ``requirements.txt`` file (run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` afterwards)
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git+ssh://git@github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy.git@0.8.1#egg=fuzzywuzzy
            
        Manually via GIT
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone git://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy.git fuzzywuzzy
            cd fuzzywuzzy
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
            >>> from fuzzywuzzy import process
        
        Simple Ratio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")
                96
        
        Partial Ratio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> fuzz.partial_ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")
                100
        
        Token Sort Ratio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> fuzz.ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
                90
            >>> fuzz.token_sort_ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
                100
        
        Token Set Ratio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> fuzz.token_sort_ratio("fuzzy was a bear", "fuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
                84
            >>> fuzz.token_set_ratio("fuzzy was a bear", "fuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
                100
        
        Process
        ~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> choices = ["Atlanta Falcons", "New York Jets", "New York Giants", "Dallas Cowboys"]
            >>> process.extract("new york jets", choices, limit=2)
                [('New York Jets', 100), ('New York Giants', 78)]
            >>> process.extractOne("cowboys", choices)
                ("Dallas Cowboys", 90)
